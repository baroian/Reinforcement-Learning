# Deep Q-Network (DQN) Implementations for CartPole

This repository contains multiple implementations of Deep Q-Networks (DQN) for solving the CartPole-v1 environment from OpenAI Gymnasium. The project explores different DQN enhancements and provides tools for comparing their performance.

## Overview

The CartPole problem is a classic reinforcement learning task where an agent must balance a pole on a moving cart. This project implements and compares several DQN variants:

1. **Baseline DQN**: A simple implementation without target networks or experience replay
2. **Target Network Only**: DQN with a separate target network for stable learning
3. **Experience Replay Only**: DQN with experience replay for better sample efficiency
4. **Both Methods**: DQN with both target networks and experience replay

## Files

- `4methods.py`: Main implementation comparing four DQN variants
- `pkl_handel.py`: Script for analyzing and visualizing experiment results
- `Assignment1.py`: Original implementation with comprehensive ablation studies
- `RandomBaselineCartPole.csv`: Data for random policy baseline
- `requirements.txt`: Required dependencies

## Installation

 Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Four DQN Methods Comparison

To run experiments comparing the four DQN variants:

```
python 4methods.py
```

This will:
- Run 5 experiments for each method (20 total)
- Save results in a sequentially numbered directory under `results/`
- Generate comparison plots and statistics

### Running Ablation Studies with Assignment1.py

To run comprehensive ablation studies on various hyperparameters:

```
python Assignment1.py
```

This will:
- Run parallel experiments testing multiple values for each hyperparameter
- Automatically select GPUs with the most available memory
- Save detailed results and visualizations in the `results/` directory
- Generate statistical analyses for each hyperparameter

### Analyzing Results

To analyze previously generated by 4methods.py results:

```
python pkl_handel.py
```

This script:
- Loads experiment results from pickle files
- Generates comparison plots
- Creates detailed statistics reports

## Assignment1.py: Comprehensive Ablation Studies
